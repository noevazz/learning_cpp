/*
Variables are spaces in memory that can hold values
you need to specify the type of the value, its name
and also its value (optional).

Define (declare) a variable:
    <type> <name of the varaible>

Assign a value:
    <name of the varaible> = <value>

You can define and assign in one line:
    <type> <name of the varaible> = <value>
(definition is only done once, you can assign different
values throughout the life of the program)

int (integer) values are numbers which are devoid of
the fractional part.
