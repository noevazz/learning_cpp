# Learning C++

## How is this repo organized?

- Find sections under the [`./codes`](./codes) directory.
    - Current sections:
        - [01_essentials](./codes/01_essentials/)
        - [02_flow_control](./codes/02_flow_control/)
- Find a screenshot of the execution of each script under the [`./img`](./img/) directory, use the following name convention: `execution_<name_of_the_script>`.

## Compilation

I used g++ 9.4.0 to compile the scripts in this repository.
Use the following command to compile each program with g++:\
> `g++ <name of the program>.cpp -o <name of the executable>`

## Execution

Use the following command to execute your program:\
> `./<name of the executable>`

You may need to grant execution privilege to the program:\
> `chmod u+x <name of the executable>`
